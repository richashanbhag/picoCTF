Description-
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
ssh -p 57693 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net
Using the password 1db87a14. Accept the fingerprint with yes, and ls once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!
Checksum: 55b983afdd9d10718f1db3983459efc5cc3f5a66841e2651041e25dec3efd46a
To decrypt the file once you've verified the hash, run ./decrypt.sh files/<file>.
Hints -
Checksums let you tell if a file is complete and from the original distributor. If the hash doesn't match, it's a different file.
Remember you can pipe the output of one command to another with |. Try practicing with the 'First Grep' challenge if you're stuck!
Method-
Using ssh get the files in the picoCTF webshell and by using the given password we can get connected.We have checksum, decrypt.sh and a lot of files, we need to find the correct one and decrypt it
The correct file will be the one, with which checksum matches and we also know that it has sha265 hash. So try sha256sum files/* | grep "5848768e56185707f76c1d74f34f4e03fb0573ecc1ca7b11238007226654bcda"
The file which is encrypted: 8eee7195

We can use decrypt.sh. So we can do ./decrypt.sh files/8eee7195

Solution-
picoCTF{trust_but_verify_8eee7195}
